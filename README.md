I use this repo to learn `next.js` and `react`. And I make some changes as follows:

- [x] upgrade the version of React and Next.js
- [x] set basePath for my production environment
- [x] auto deploy to github page by github action
- [ ] switch to app router

If you want to try this repo, simply clone it and run `npm install` and `npm run dev` (my node version is `v20.18.0`).
